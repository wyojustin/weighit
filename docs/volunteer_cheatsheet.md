## Tallying Donations (Repeat for each item/bag)

### 7. Weigh Each Item/Bag
- **Place the item or bag on the scale**
- Wait for the weight to stabilize (watch the **scale display itself**, not the app—the number stops changing)
- Note the weight shown on the scale

### 8. Log the Entry
- **Click the button** for the donation type:
  - **Produce** (fruits, vegetables)
  - **Dry** (canned goods, grains, pasta)
  - **Dairy** (milk, cheese, yogurt)
  - **Meat** (chicken, beef, pork, fish)
  - **Prepared** (ready-to-eat meals)
  - **Bread** (baked goods)
  - **Non-food** (toiletries, household items)
- **Handle Temperature Recording (if applicable)**:
  - If the donation type is **Dairy**, **Meat**, or **Prepared**, you will be prompted for temperatures
  - Enter the **pickup temperature**
  - Enter the **dropoff temperature**
  - Click **"Save Entry"** to confirm the temperatures, or **Cancel** to go back
- **Confirm what you saw**: The large weight displayed at the center top should match what you saw on the scale
  - If it doesn't match, use **Admin >> Undo** or press **Ctrl+Z** to remove the last reading

### 9. Continue to Next Item
- Remove the item from the scale
- The scale should reset to zero automatically
