# WeighIt Volunteer Cheat Sheet

## Setup (Do this at the start of your shift)

### 1. Power On the PineTab2
- **Hold the power button for 3 seconds**
- Nothing happens immediately—wait patiently
- You'll know it's working when the **keyboard lights up a few seconds later**

### 2. Connect the Scale
- **Plug the Dymo scale into the USB port**
- Use the USB-C converter if necessary

### 3. Power On the Scale
- **Press and hold the kg/lb button**
- While holding it, **tap the power button**
- This prevents the scale from going to sleep during operation

### 4. Launch WeighIt
- When the desktop appears, **click the WeighIt icon** in the upper left corner
- **Wait 30 seconds** for the app to start up
- Be patient—it takes time to initialize

### 5. Troubleshoot if Needed
- If the weight display shows **------** (horizontal bars):
  - **Press F5** on the keyboard to reload the app
  - This happens occasionally and is normal

### 6. Select Donor Source
- The **donor dropdown** is located at the top center of the screen, **above the weight display**
- **Click the dropdown** and select the current donor source (e.g., "Trader Joe's", "Whole Foods")
- This will apply to all items you log during this session

## Tallying Donations (Repeat for each item/bag)

### 7. Weigh Each Item/Bag
- **Place the item or bag on the scale**
- Wait for the weight to stabilize (watch the **scale display itself**, not the app—the number stops changing)
- Note the weight shown on the scale

### 8. Log the Entry
- **Click the button** for the donation type:
  - **Produce** (fruits, vegetables)
  - **Dry** (canned goods, grains, pasta)
  - **Dairy** (milk, cheese, yogurt)
  - **Meat** (chicken, beef, pork, fish)
  - **Prepared** (ready-to-eat meals)
  - **Bread** (baked goods)
  - **Non-food** (toiletries, household items)
- **Handle Temperature Recording (if applicable)**:
  - If the donation type is **Dairy**, **Meat**, or **Prepared**, you will be prompted for temperatures
  - The **pickup temperature** field will be auto-selected—just start typing to replace it
  - Tab to the **dropoff temperature** field and enter the temperature
  - Press **Enter** or click **"Save Entry"** to confirm the temperatures
  - Or click **Cancel** to go back
- **Confirm what you saw**: The large weight displayed at the center top should match what you saw on the scale
  - If it doesn't match, use **Admin >> Undo** or press **Ctrl+Z** to remove the last reading

### 9. Continue to Next Item
- Remove the item from the scale
- The scale should reset to zero automatically
- Repeat steps 7-9 for the next item

  - The last entry will be removed
  - You can undo multiple times if needed

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Scale shows **------** | Press **F5** to reload the app |
| Scale shows **Err** | Check that scale is plugged in via USB (not on batteries), then press **F5** |
| Weight won't stabilize | Make sure the scale is on a flat, stable surface |
| App is frozen | Press **F5** to reload, or restart the app |
| Wrong donation type logged | Use the **Undo** button (Ctrl+Z) |
| Scale not detected | Unplug and replug the USB cable, then press **F5** |

### If Nothing Works

If you've tried the troubleshooting steps above and the WeighIt app still isn't working:

1. **Don't panic!** This is technology, and sometimes it happens.

2. **Apologize to the donor** and let them know:
   - "I'm sorry, our digital scale system is having technical difficulties right now."
   - "We're still happy to accept your donation! We'll just record it the old-fashioned way."

3. **Fall back to manual recording:**
   - **Grab a pen and paper** (or notebook)
   - **Weigh each item** on the scale (the scale itself still works—it's just the computer connection that's having issues)
   - **Write down**:
     - Donor name/source (e.g., "Trader Joe's")
     - Food type (Produce, Dairy, Meat, etc.)
     - Weight in pounds
     - Current date and time
   
4. **After your shift:**
   - Contact the coordinator and let them know the system had issues
   - Provide your handwritten notes so the data can be entered later

**Remember**: The most important thing is accepting and tracking the donations. The app makes it easier, but pen and paper works too!
